# DevOps Interview Technical Resources

This is an example deployment of an Apache Airflow instance using Terraform and a home-grown Helm Chart. Before your interview we would like you to:

* Think about what problems there might be with the approach and the specifics of the implementation
* Think about how you might fix them or do things differently
* Anything goes, we want to hear your opinion! The only things out of scope are the choice to use Kubernetes and the choice to run Airflow (the application is not important)
* We don't expect you to do anything except maybe make some notes to discuss with us in the interview
